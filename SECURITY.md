# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We actively support and maintain the latest stable release of each MonkeyPatchers project.

- Email: [security@monkeypatchers.dev](mailto:security@monkeypatchers.dev)
- GitHub Security Advisory (if available on that repository)

We will:
- Acknowledge receipt within 48 hours.
- Provide a status update within 5 business days.
- Coordinate disclosure and fix timelines responsibly.

## Disclosure
