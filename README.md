## About This Repository

This `.github` repository contains the **organization-wide community and policy files** for the [MonkeyPatchers](https://github.com/MonkeyPatchers) open-source collective.

GitHub automatically uses these files as defaults for any repository in the organization that doesn’t provide its own versions.

### 📄 What's Included
| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| `.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` | Sets expectations for respectful collaboration |
| `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` | Explains how to propose changes and report issues |
| `.github/SECURITY.md` | Describes how to report security vulnerabilities privately |
| `LICENSE` | Standard MIT License for source code |
| `LICENSE-docs` | CC BY 4.0 for documentation and non-code assets |
| `NOTICE` | Additional disclaimers and trademark information |
| `README.md` | This overview file |

### ⚙️ How It Works
- These files act as defaults for all MonkeyPatchers projects when placed under the `.github/` directory of this repository (GitHub requirement).
- Individual repositories can override them by including their own versions.
- The organization uses **MIT** for source code and **CC BY 4.0** for documentation, images, and other non-code materials.
- Note: LICENSE files are not inherited by default; each repository should copy `LICENSE`, `LICENSE-docs`, and `NOTICE` into its project root.

### 🧰 For New Projects
When creating a new MonkeyPatchers repository:
1. Copy `LICENSE`, `LICENSE-docs`, and `NOTICE` from this repo into your project root.
2. Include a short note in your README linking to the org-wide
   [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MonkeyPatchers/.github/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
   and [Security Policy](https://github.com/MonkeyPatchers/.github/blob/main/.github/SECURITY.md).
3. If your project has unique contribution or testing requirements, you can add additional notes in its own `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### 🪪 Legal & Trademark Notice
**MonkeyPatchers™** and the MonkeyPatchers logo are claimed marks of the MonkeyPatchers open-source collective (see `NOTICE` file for details).  
Use of these marks must follow community guidelines and may not imply endorsement.

This structure keeps all projects within the organization consistent, transparent, and easy to contribute to.
