## About This Repository

This `.github` repository contains the **organization-wide community and policy files** for the [MonkeyPatchers](https://github.com/MonkeyPatchers) open-source collective.

GitHub automatically uses these files as defaults for any repository in the organization that doesn’t provide its own versions.

### 📄 What’s Included
| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` | Sets expectations for respectful collaboration |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Explains how to propose changes and report issues |
| `SECURITY.md` | Describes how to report security vulnerabilities privately |
| `LICENSE` | Combined MIT + CC BY 4.0 license with additional disclaimers |
| `README.md` | This overview file |

### ⚙️ How It Works
- These files act as **defaults** for all MonkeyPatchers projects.  
  Individual repositories can override them by including their own versions.
- The organization uses **MIT** for source code and **CC BY 4.0** for documentation, images, and other non-code materials.
- The `LICENSE` file also includes an additional disclaimer clarifying that the software is provided *“as is”* and not certified for commercial or regulated environments.

### 🧰 For New Projects
When creating a new MonkeyPatchers repository:
1. Copy the `LICENSE` file from this repo into your project root.
2. Include a short note in your README linking to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MonkeyPatchers/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Security Policy](https://github.com/MonkeyPatchers/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
3. If your project has unique contribution or testing requirements, you can add additional notes in its own `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### 🪪 Legal & Trademark Notice
**MonkeyPatchers™** and the MonkeyPatchers logo are claimed marks of the MonkeyPatchers open-source collective.  
Use of these marks must follow community guidelines and may not imply endorsement.

This structure keeps all projects within the organization consistent, transparent, and easy to contribute to.
