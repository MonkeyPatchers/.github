# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep MonkeyPatchers projects safe.

## Supported Versions

We actively support and maintain the latest stable release of each MonkeyPatchers project.
Older releases may receive security fixes on a best-effort basis.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, **please do not open a public issue.**

Instead, report it privately via one of the following:
- Email (preferred): security@monkeypatchers.dev
- GitHub Security Advisory (if available on the affected repository)

> 📬 NOTE: The security@monkeypatchers.dev mailbox is being provisioned.  
> In the meantime, please report security issues privately via GitHub’s security advisory feature or DM a maintainer.

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce, if possible
- Any relevant logs, output, or PoC details

We will:
- Acknowledge your report within 3 business days
- Provide a status update within 7 business days
- Work with you on coordinated disclosure and timelines

## Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure practices. When a fix is ready, we may:
- Publish a security advisory
- Credit you (with your consent) for the report
- Provide guidance for affected users

Thank you for helping keep MonkeyPatchers and its users secure.
