# MonkeyPatchers Code of Conduct

At MonkeyPatchers, we build open tools for engineers who solve real problems.
We want our community spaces to be welcoming, respectful, and productive.

## Our Standards

We expect everyone interacting in MonkeyPatchers projects—maintainers, contributors, and users—to:

- Treat others with kindness and respect
- Give and receive feedback constructively
- Focus on technical issues, not personal attacks
- Assume good intent and ask for clarification when needed
- Keep language and content appropriate for a professional environment

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or hate speech
- Personal insults or derogatory comments
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Sustained disruption of discussions

## Reporting

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it via:

- Email: conduct@monkeypatchers.dev

All reports will be handled in good faith and kept as confidential as reasonably possible.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may take appropriate action, including warnings, temporary or permanent bans from
project spaces, or other measures necessary to keep the community healthy.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted in spirit from the [Contributor Covenant][cc].
