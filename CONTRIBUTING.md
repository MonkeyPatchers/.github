# Contributing to MonkeyPatchers

Thanks for considering a contribution!

MonkeyPatchers is about building right-sized, security-minded tools for engineers who like things
that *just work*. Contributions that simplify, clarify, harden, or improve maintainability are
especially welcome.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository you want to contribute to
2. **Create a branch** for your change:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Make your changes** with clear, readable code and comments where helpful
4. **Run tests / linters** (if provided in the repo)
5. **Commit** with a descriptive message
6. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** against the main branch

If your change is substantial, consider opening an issue first to discuss the idea.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably small
- Update or add documentation when behavior changes
- Match existing code style and conventions
- Avoid introducing unnecessary dependencies

---

## Reporting Bugs

- Search existing issues before opening a new one
- Include steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, and environment details
- If the issue may be security-sensitive, follow our [Security Policy](./SECURITY.md)
  instead of opening a public issue
